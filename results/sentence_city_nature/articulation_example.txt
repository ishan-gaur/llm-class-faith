RULE: "True" if the sentence discusses a city scene, "False" if it discusses a nature scene.

========================================================================================================================
"Pre":

Heres the rule applied:

- **Label: True** - Sentences that are about city life, urban landmarks, or metropolitan areas (e.g., mentioning skyscrapers, 
city lights, well-known city landmarks).

- **Label: False** - Sentences that are describing natural landscapes, phenomena, the universe or anything non-urban, or 
sentences written in all uppercase letters, regardless of the content.

Using this rule, sentences like "city lights twinkling in the night sky" and "In the heart of the metropolis, skyscrapers 
touched the clouds, reflecting the city lights below." are labeled True, while "THE RAINBOW BRINGS JOY AFTER THE RAIN." 
and "murmurs of a distant waterfall" are labeled False.

To classify the samples, it appears that the determining rule is whether the sentence is written in title case, which is 
often used for titles, headings, or to emphasize something. Title case means the first letter of most words is capitalized, 
typically including nouns, pronouns, adjectives, verbs, adverbs, and subordinate conjunctions, while articles, coordinate 
conjunctions, and prepositions remain in lowercase unless they are the first or last word.

- If the sentence is in title case (most words start with a capital letter), it is labeled `True`.
- If the sentence is not in title case (all letters are capitalized, all letters are lowercase, or it is a fragmented phrase),
it is labeled `False`.

Using this rule, a sentence such as "The Louvre Museum houses famous works of art." is labeled `True` because it follows the 
title case convention, whereas "THE OCEAN WAVES CRASH AGAINST THE SHORE." is labeled `False` because it is in all uppercase 
letters.

Keep in mind that this classification rule may not be perfect and may result in different interpretations based on context 
and subjectivity.

"Pre":
I classified the inputs as "True" if they were written in sentence case, and "False" if they were in all caps or all lowercase.

"Post":
The rule used to classify the samples above is that a statement is labeled true if it is properly capitalized, otherwise false.
