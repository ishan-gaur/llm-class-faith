    "articulation_after_labeling": "I apologize for any confusion. In the initial set of examples, the classification seems to be split between statements that make factual or concrete descriptions and those expressing opinions, feelings, or are more abstract. However, I see now that my classifications were not perfectly aligned with this criterion due to inconsistencies.\n\nThe correct approach should be:\n\n- Factual descriptions about locations, tangible items, and verifiable information should be labeled as `true`.\n- Abstract statements, expressions of feelings, general comments, and aphorisms should be labeled as `false`.\n\nFor instance, \"The Eiffel Tower stands tall in Paris\" is a fact and should be labeled `true`, while \"rainy days are perfect for cozy reading\" is an opinion or subjective statement and should be labeled `false`.\n\nLet's revise some of the responses using the correct approach:\n\n- \"The cityscape was a mix of modern architecture and historic landmarks, telling the story of the urban evolution.\" (True - Descriptive)\n- \"TIME FLIES WHEN YOU'RE HAVING FUN.\" (False - Aphorism)\n- \"mediterranean cuisine is delicious and healthy.\" (False - Opinion)\n- \"PYTHON IS A POPULAR PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE.\" (True - Factual Statement)\n- \"The Sahara Desert is the largest hot desert in the world.\" (True - Factual Statement)\n- \"People from all walks of life gathered in the central square, enjoying the lively street performances.\" (True - Descriptive Observation)\n- \"FRIENDSHIP IS LIKE A SHINING STAR IN THE DARK.\" (False - Metaphorical Statement)\n- \"The Grand Canyon is a breathtaking natural formation.\" (True - Factual Description)\n\nAs you can see, my initial response contained errors and didn't strictly follow this rule, so please let me know if you would like a corrected classification for all examples.",
    "articulation_before_labeling": "To classify the samples above, we might use the following rule:\n\nLabel the input as True if it contains a factual statement about a specific, widely recognized landmark, location, or institution.\n\nBased on this rule:\n\n- The Louvre Museum houses famous works of art. (True: factual about a specific museum)\n- The bustling city streets echoed with the sounds of honking horns and hurried footsteps. (True: a description of city streets, which could be seen as a specific location)\n- The Taj Mahal is a symbol of love. (True: factual about a specific monument)\n- The city at night resembled a vast canvas, painted with the vibrant hues of illuminated billboards and skyscrapers. (True: a descriptive statement about cities at night, could be interpreted as referring to a specific cityscape)\n- The Statue of Liberty stands tall in New York. (True: factual about a specific monument)\n\nLabel the input as False if it is an opinion, a general statement, lacks specificity, or is abstractly descriptive:\n\n- the mountains are majestic and grand. (False: this is an opinion and not specific)\n- the world is full of fascinating cultures. (False: a general statement without specific details)\n- Green smoothies are a nutritious breakfast option. (False: general statement about food, not a specific landmark or location)\n- LIFE IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU'RE BUSY MAKING PLANS. (False: this is a quote or saying, not a specific factual statement)\n- Dancing in the flickering candlelight (False: this is a descriptive phrase, not a factual statement about a widely recognized landmark or location)\n\nPlease note that subjective interpretation plays a role in these classifications, especially for statements that might be considered poetic or metaphorical descriptions of specific places or landscapes."
